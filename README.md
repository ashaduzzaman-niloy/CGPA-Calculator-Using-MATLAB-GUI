# CGPA-Calculator-Using-MATLAB-GUI
In this 4th semester project of ours, we had created a near proprietary CGPA calculator using Graphical User Interface (GUI) function of MATLAB. Using this, a user can generate result of a batch of students or a single student.  

1. Run "Batch_CGPA.exe" in windows or "batchmode.m" in MATLAB.
2. Input required information into GUI.
3. See the Batch Result or Individual Result.
4. Follow this youtube video for more details: https://youtu.be/lgQhhuvDDUY
